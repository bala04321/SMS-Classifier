# SMS-Classifier
Develop a text classification model to classify SMS as either spam or non-spam using data science techniques in Python. The goal is to automatically identify whether an incoming SMS is likely to be unwanted spam or a legitimate message.An SMS classifier is a machine learning model designed to automatically categorize Short Message Service (SMS) messages as either spam or non-spam (ham). The process involves collecting a labeled dataset of SMS messages, preprocessing the text data, and using machine learning algorithms to train a model. 
Common techniques include TF-IDF or word embeddings for feature extraction and algorithms such as Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines for classification. The model is then evaluated on a testing dataset, and fine-tuning may be performed to optimize its performance. Once satisfactory, the model can be deployed to classify incoming SMS messages, providing an automated solution to identify and filter unwanted spam messages from legitimate ones.And also we create one website to check that the message is an spam or non-spam.
